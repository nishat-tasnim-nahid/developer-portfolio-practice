            <h3>1. There is no edge of the universe</h3>
            <p>There is one edge we know of - our horizon, which is the limit of how far we can see.Imagine sailing on a
                boat on the ocean and seeing a horizon in the distance, past which you know there is more Earth, but you
                just can't see it. We've measured the universe to be flat (as opposed to curved like Earth or
                saddle-shaped), but our horizon exists because of the finite speed of light. Beyond that visible
                horizon, we think the universe just keeps going in the same way - forever.</p>

            <h2>The Second One</h2>
            <h3>3.There is no centre of the universe</h3>
            <p>The universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.But the
                Big Bang should
                not be imagined as a normal explosion in space. Rather, the Big Bang is an explosion of space itself, so
                that every point in space expands equally away from every other point in space. There is no centre to
                the expansion.From our galaxy we measure that all galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther the
                galaxy, the faster away it is moving.</p>

    <h1>The Earth in The Universe</h1>

            <h2>The Earth is our Homeland </h2>
            <h3 class="color-ag">Our home planet provides us with life and protects us from space.</h3>
            <p>Earth's atmosphere is 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and one percent other gases such as carbon
                dioxide, water vapor, and argon. Much like a greenhouse, this blanket of gases absorbs and retains heat.
                On average, Earth's surface temperature is about 57 degrees Fahrenheit; without our atmosphere, it'd be
                zero degrees. In the last two centuries, humans have added enough greenhouse gases to the atmosphere to
                raise Earth's average temperature by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit. This extra heat has altered Earth's weather
                patterns in many ways.</p>

            <h2>The Universe is Earth's Homeland</h2>
            <h3 class="color-ag">The universe is everything,everything and everything.</h3>
            <p>It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself
                and, of course, it includes you.Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets
                and their many dozens of moons. Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. The Sun is
                one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own
                planets, known as exoplanets.</p>
