            <h3>1. There is no edge of the universe</h3>
            <p>There is one edge we know of - our horizon, which is the limit of how far we can see.Imagine sailing on a
                boat on the ocean and seeing a horizon in the distance, past which you know there is more Earth, but you
                just can't see it. We've measured the universe to be flat (as opposed to curved like Earth or
                saddle-shaped), but our horizon exists because of the finite speed of light. Beyond that visible
                horizon, we think the universe just keeps going in the same way - forever.</p>

            <h3>3.There is no centre of the universe</h3>
            <p>The universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.But the
                Big Bang should
                not be imagined as a normal explosion in space. Rather, the Big Bang is an explosion of space itself, so
                that every point in space expands equally away from every other point in space. There is no centre to
                the expansion.From our galaxy we measure that all galaxies are moving away from us, and the farther the
                galaxy, the faster away it is moving.</p>
